simple_testcase1: Test basic funtionality of malloc537, free537, memcheck537

simple_testcase2: Allocating memory of size 0
	-> Your program is expected to throw a warning and continue execution for malloc537(0)
	-> But when trying to free the pointer, program should throw error and exit

simple_testcase3: Trying to free a wrong address
	-> You program should throw error and exit, when trying to free a memory location

simple_testcase4: Freeing an already freed pointer (Double free)

simple_testcase5: Allocating a memory and then reallocating for a bigger size
